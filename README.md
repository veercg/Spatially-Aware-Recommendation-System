# Spatially-Aware-Recommendation-System
Recommender systems help users in making 
decisions by recommending items of interest like movies, 
music, books, news, images, web pages,  etc. to them. 
Collaborative filtering is one  of the most widely studied and 
widely  used  techniques  behind  recommendation  algorithms.  It 
tries to recommend items to users based on user-user or item- 
item similarities computed from existing data. In this work, we 
propose  a  recommendation  algorithm  that  takes  the  user's 
location  into  account.  The  algorithm  uses  Voronoi  Diagrams 
which are widely used in Computational  Geometry to 
decompose a metric space into regions based on distances from 
a specified finite set of points. We have tested the algorithm on 
the MovieLens dataset
